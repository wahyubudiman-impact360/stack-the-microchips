#This script was created 17/5/2010 by Paul Tero (www.tero.co.uk/scripts/minify.php) to remove comments
#and extra spaces from Javascript and CSS files.

#There must be at least 2 arguments, which is the CSS and JS files to compress
if test $# -lt 2; then echo Usage $0 Input-CSS-or-JS-file Output-CSS-or-JS-file; exit 1; fi

#If the file name is something like myfile-raw.js, then it will output automatically to myfile.js, removing the -raw.
outfile=`echo $2 | sed -e "s|-raw.\(.*\)$|.\1|"`

#This command removes comments from CSS and Javascript files using sed. First it replaces /**/ and /*\*/ with 
#/~~/ and /~\~/ as these comments are used as CSS hacks and should stay in the file. Then it removes /*...*/ style
#comments on single lines (from Javascript and CSS files). Then it removes // style comments from Javascript files
#(done in this order so that comments like /*...//...*/ get removed properly). Then it replaces all newlines with
#spaces and removes /*...*/ style comments again (this time over multiple lines). Then it puts the /**/ and /*\*/
#CSS hacks back in. Then it replaces multiple spaces with single spaces. Then it removes spaces before [{;:,] and
#then spaces after [{:;,].
