IF GAME DOESN'T HAVE THIS, HOW TO IMPLEMENT IN OUR PROJECT?
Based on impactjs-marketjs-platform repository as source:

dev.html, insert <!-- APICode -->
dev.js
production.js
DO NOT INSERT API CODE INTO main.js, because it'll get scrambled and mistakes happen
Insert into other parts of the game (eg: brain.js)

When in doubt, use Emoji Quiz as sample
