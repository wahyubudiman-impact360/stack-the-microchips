IF GAME DOESN'T HAVE THIS, HOW TO IMPLEMENT IN OUR PROJECT?
Based on impactjs-marketjs-platform repository as source:

dev.html must have latest code (Ad rotation DIVs)
dev.js must have ad rotation script
copy paste entire settings folder (contains JS,CSS,etc)

handler.js 
- must have all the DIVs in advancedDivsToResize
- try/catch in "for(key in advancedDivsToResize){" loop
