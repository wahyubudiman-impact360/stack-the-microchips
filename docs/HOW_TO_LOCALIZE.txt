IF GAME DOESN'T HAVE THIS, HOW TO IMPLEMENT IN OUR PROJECT?
Based on impactjs-marketjs-platform repository as source:

replace media files 1-1 (check promo artwork,splash,etc)
strings.js
check splash-loader.js
create push-LANG-fresh.sh, push-LANG.sh
create backup of current language in _factory/backup

Finally... add game language in MarketJS platform (metadata)
